One thing to be noted is that while the superstore is incurring losses due to giving discounts on its products, they can't stop giving discounts of their products. Most of the heavy discounts are during festivals, end-of-season and clearance sales which are necessary so that the store can make space in their warehouses for fresh stock. Also, by incurring small losses, the company gains in the future by attracting more long term customers. Therefore, the small losses from discounts are an essential part of company's business.
